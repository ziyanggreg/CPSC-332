Dear Student,

As part of course 332, you are expected to work on a real time database and identify some concepts that we study in the course. This is an individual completed assignment and no group collaboration is entertained. You are expected to come up with a document, with .pdf extension only.  

As you all know that we keep using databases as part of our day-to-day life. You will have to select a database of your choice, {for example it can be a Hospital database or a Retail Store database}.

Requirements in the report include :

1. Give some basic comments on database, database terminology (which is used in your case study).

2. Construct a well defined UML Class Diagram with all constraints and relations.

3. Construct a well defined ER Diagram with all constraints and relations.

4. Give some comments on SQL programming.

5. Create a sample database, perform some basic operations (insert, delete, update, drop)

6. Attach the screenshots of the output at each stage.  

7. Do not forget to give citations and references where and when necessary.

Hope you learn new things out of this work.
